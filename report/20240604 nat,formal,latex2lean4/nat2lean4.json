If it rains, there is a 10% chance that we will be allowed to go outside; otherwise, there is an 80% chance we will be able to go outside. What is the probability that we will be allowed to go outside?\\nSolution: We split this into the case that it rains and the case that it doesn't. The probability that it rains and we go outside is (0.20)(0.10) = 0.02. The probability that it doesn't rain and we go outside is (1 - 0.20)(0.80) = 0.64. The overall probability that we go outside is then the sum of these, or 0.64 + 0.02 = 0.66."
