If it rains, there is a 10% chance that we will be allowed to go outside; otherwise, there is an 80% chance we will be able to go outside. What is the probability that we will be allowed to go outside?\\nLet ùëÖ denote the event \\\"it rains today,\\\" and ùëÇ denote the event \\\"we are allowed to go outside.\\\" We are asked to calculate the probability of ùëÇ. Given:\\nThe probability of rain: P(R)=0.20.\\nThe probability of no rain: P(¬¨R)=1‚àíP(R)=0.80.\\nThe conditional probability of being allowed outside given that it rains: P(O‚à£R)=0.10.\\nThe conditional probability of being allowed outside given that it does not rain: P(O‚à£¬¨R)=0.80.\\nWe need to find P(O), the total probability of being allowed to go outside. According to the law of total probability: P(O)=P(O‚à£R)‚ãÖP(R)+P(O‚à£¬¨R)‚ãÖP(¬¨R)\\nSubstituting the given values: P(O)=(0.10‚ãÖ0.20)+(0.80‚ãÖ0.80)\\nCalculating this: P(O)=0.02+0.64=0.66\\nTherefore, the probability that we will be allowed to go outside is 0.66."
